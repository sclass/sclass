### 🛠 Source & Infrastructure Management
- GitLab (internal) — Official development infrastructure for EnGIS and subsidiaries
- GitHub (`xclass78`) — Temporary, limited-scope customer collaboration
- GitHub (`sclass`) — Personal, non-operational identity anchor
- AWS CodeSuite — Used where applicable for global delivery pipelines
- SORA Project — Managed in a multi-layer secured, access-controlled infrastructure

> All official repositories are managed under EnGIS-controlled private infrastructure. GitHub is only used where explicitly required.
